# Volkslieder
This repository contains a website that gathers historical German songs. The site is built in an MVC fashion, with pages being populated dynamically using data from a MySQL database and rendered with a custom templating and routing system, with Javascript translating content dynamically.

The website can be accessed [at this link](http://volkslieder.epizy.com/home?dc=en).
